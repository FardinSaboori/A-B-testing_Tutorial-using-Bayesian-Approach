# A-B-testing_Tutorial-using-Bayesian-Approach
## In this notebook i have applied both Frequentist and Bayesian approach to perform A/B analysis to analyze the results of a campaign.
### Key points to note:
* Frequentist approach involves hypothesis test and the use of Chi-squred test.
* Bayesian approach involves the Beta distribution and constructing the prior and posterior distributions.
For more info on the Beta distribution please check this out:
